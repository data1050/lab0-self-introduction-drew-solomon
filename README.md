Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :) 

Hi! My name is Drew Solomon, and I am from Geneva, Switzerland. My favorite foods from home are fondue and raclette (both mostly cheese). 
I am a 5th-year master's student, and recently completed my bachelor's degree in Behavioral Decision Sciences.

Thanks!
